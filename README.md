# Vero

## Overview

**Vero** is a web application designed to help users who feel unsafe by allowing them to capture and save a live stream directly to their Google Drive with a single click. This feature provides a way to create a record of events if users need to provide evidence or protect themselves later. The name **Vero** is derived from Latin, meaning "true," which reflects the appâ€™s aim to offer genuine and reliable evidence.

## Current Status

I am currently exploring Java and SQL, and this project is a learning journey for me. I have a basic understanding of the tech stack required but don't yet have complete knowledge or experience in all aspects of the project. I have started implementing the core features, including the frontend, and am eager to learn more about the backend tech stacks required to complete the application.

## Features

- Capture a live stream and save it directly to Google Drive.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.

## Tech Stack

  - HTML/CSS
  - JavaScript
  - (Optional) React or Vue.js for advanced UI

- **Backend:**
